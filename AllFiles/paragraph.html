    <h1>HISTORY OF KENYA</h1>
    <p>
Modern-day Kenya emerged from a protectorate established by the <span id="british">British<br>
Empire</span> in <b> 1895</b> and the subsequent Kenya Colony, which began in <b>1920</b>.<br>
Numerous disputes between the <span id="uk">UK</span> and the colony led to the <span id="mau">Mau Mau<br>
revolution</span>, which began in <b>1952</b>, and the declaration of independence in <b>1963</b>.
